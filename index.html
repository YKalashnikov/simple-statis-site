      <h2>Mount Everest: World's Highest Mountain</h2>
      <p>
        Reaching 29,029 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level, Mount Everest is
        the highest mountain on Earth. Located in the Mahalangur section of the
        Himalayas, the mountain's summit straddles the border separating China
        and Nepal. The mountain's height was first determined in 1856. The Great
        Trigonometric Survey of British India pegged the mountain, known to them
        as Peak XV, at 29,002 feet (8,840 meters). But those surveyors were at a
        disadvantage because Nepal would not grant them entry due to concerns
        that the country would be invaded or annexed. The current accepted
        elevation was determined by an Indian survey in 1955 and backed up by a
        1975 Chinese measurement.

      <h2>Weather</h2>
      <p>
        The Jet Stream sits on top of Everest almost all year long The wind can
        blow over 200 mph The temperature can be -80F In mid May each year, the
        jet stream moves north causing the winds the calm and temperatures to
        warm enough for people to try to summit. This is called the 'summit
        window'. There is a similar period each fall in November. It can also be
        very hot with temperatures over 100F in the Western Cwm, an area
        climbers go through to reach the summit.

      <h2>Climbing</h2>
      <p>
        There are 18 different climbing routes on Everest It takes 40 days to
        climb Mt. Everest in order for the body to adjust to the high altitude
        There is 66% less oxygen in each breath on the summit of Everest than at
        sea level Thin nylon ropes are used to keep climbers from falling.
        Climbers wear spikes on their boots called crampons They also use ice
        axes to help stop a fall Thick, puffy suits filled with goose feathers
        keep climbers warm Most climbers eat a lot of rice and noodles for food
        Almost all climbers use bottled oxygen because it is so high. It helps
        keep the climbers warm. Climbers start using bottled oxygen at 26,000
        feet but it only makes a 3,000 foot difference in how they feel so at
        27,000 feet, they feel like they are at 24,000 feet You have to be 16 or
        older to climb from the Nepal side and between 18 and 60 on the Chinese
        side. The average expedition takes about 39 days.

      <h2>Sherpas</h2>
      <p>
        Sherpa is the name of a people. They mostly live in western Nepal. They
        migrated from Tibet over the last several hundred years Sherpa is also
        used as a last name Usually their first name is the day of the week they
        were born. Nyima - Sunday Dawa - Monday Mingma - Tuesday Lhakpa -
        Wednesday Phurba - Thursday Pasang - Friday Pemba - Saturday Sherpas
        help climbers by carrying tents and cooking food to the High Camps
        Sherpas climb Everest as a job to support their families Sherpas can get
        sick from the altitude like anyone Sherpas feel it is disrespectful to
        stand literally on the tippy top since that is where Miyolangsangma, the
        Tibetan Goddess of Mountains, lives.

      <h2>Death Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        288 people (173 westerners and 115 Sherpas) have died on Everest from
        1924 to June 2017 or 3.4% , a rate of 1.22 Of the deaths, 168 died
        attempting to summit without using supplemental oxygen. Of the 288
        deaths, 71 died on the descent after their summit or 25% The Nepalese
        side has seen 5,280 summits with 181 deaths through June 2017 or 3.6%, a
        rate of 1.27. 121 died not using Os. The Tibet side has seen 3,206
        summits with 107 deaths through June 2017 or 3.7%, a rate of 1.15. 47
        died not using Os. Most bodies all are still on the mountain but China
        has removed many bodies from sight. The top causes of death on both
        sides were from avalanche (77), fall (67), altitude sickness (32) and
        exposure (26). About 63% of all expeditions put at least one member on
        the summit. From 1923 to 1999: 170 people died on Everest with 1,169
        summits or 14.5%. But the deaths drastically declined from 2000 to 2017
        with 7,056 summits and 118 deaths or 1.7%. However, two years skewed the
        deaths rates with 17 in 2014 and 14 in 2015. The reduction in deaths is
        primarily due to better gear, weather forecasting and more people
        climbing with commercial operations.

      <h2>Concerned Environmental Problems</h2>
      <p>
        During every best time to visit Mount Everest, many mountaineers left
        lots of wastes there and later add more new rubbish after new visiting,
        things like abandoned oxygen carriers, mountaineering equipment and
        human excreta are everywhere on Mount Everest. To improve the
        environmental damage situation, Nepal government has introduced a new
        policy that each climber has to take 8kg (18 pounds) wastes down the
        mountain, otherwise the deposit of 4,000 dollars will be detained.
        Moreover, every year local Tibetans also organize many volunteers to
        clean the waste on Mount Everest. In the latest spring cleanup of 2017,
        more than 4.5 tons garbage was picked up from EBC areas and disposed
        after transported to down the hill.
